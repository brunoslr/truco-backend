## 🔄 Main Cleanup Activities

### 1. **GameFlowEventHandler Complete Removal**

#### **Problem Identified:**
The original `GameFlowEventHandler` violated the Single Responsibility Principle by handling multiple disparate concerns:
- Card play flow and round progression
- Truco/raise response management
- Hand completion and termination logic

#### **Solution Implemented:**
**✅ COMPLETELY REMOVED** `GameFlowEventHandler.cs` and replaced with three specialized handlers:

##### **A. RoundFlowEventHandler**
- **File:** `TrucoMineiro.API/Domain/EventHandlers/RoundFlowEventHandler.cs`
- **Responsibility:** Manages round progression after card plays
- **Handles:** `CardPlayedEvent`
- **Key Features:**
  - Player turn advancement
  - Round completion detection and winner determination  
  - Round-to-round transition logic
  - Publishing `RoundCompletedEvent` and `PlayerTurnStartedEvent`

##### **B. TrucoResponseFlowEventHandler**
- **File:** `TrucoMineiro.API/Domain/EventHandlers/TrucoResponseFlowEventHandler.cs`
- **Responsibility:** Manages game flow after Truco calls and raises
- **Handles:** `TrucoRaiseEvent`
- **Key Features:**
  - Stakes updates and game state management
  - Response player activation for Truco responses
  - Available actions management for Truco scenarios

##### **C. HandCompletionEventHandler**
- **File:** `TrucoMineiro.API/Domain/EventHandlers/HandCompletionEventHandler.cs`
- **Responsibility:** Manages hand termination and new hand setup
- **Handles:** `SurrenderHandEvent`
- **Key Features:**
  - Score updates from hand surrender
  - Game completion detection
  - New hand initialization

### 2. **Terminology Migration: FoldHand → SurrenderHand**

#### **Changes Made:**
- **✅ Removed:** `FoldHandEvent.cs` (completely deleted)
- **✅ Updated:** All event handler references to use `SurrenderHandEvent`
- **✅ Fixed:** Property naming consistency (`CurrentStakes` → `CurrentStake`)
- **✅ Updated:** Controller actions (`ButtonPressActions.Fold` → `ButtonPressActions.Surrender`)
- **✅ Updated:** Command classes (`FoldCommand` → `SurrenderHandCommand`)

#### **Clarification Documentation:**
Maintained comprehensive documentation in `FOLD_ACTIONS_CLARIFICATION.md` distinguishing:
- **Round Fold** (`isFold: true` in card play) - Tactical round decision
- **Surrender Hand** (`action: "surrender"` button press) - Strategic hand termination

### 3. **Dependency Injection Updates**

#### **Program.cs Changes:**
```csharp
// OLD - Monolithic handler
// builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventHandler<CardPlayedEvent>, GameFlowEventHandler>();
// builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventHandler<TrucoRaiseEvent>, GameFlowEventHandler>();

// NEW - Specialized handlers
builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventHandler<CardPlayedEvent>, RoundFlowEventHandler>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventHandler<TrucoRaiseEvent>, TrucoResponseFlowEventHandler>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventHandler<SurrenderHandEvent>, HandCompletionEventHandler>();
```

### 4. **GameStateMachine Enhancements**

#### **Missing Method Implementation:**
- **✅ Implemented:** `ProcessPlayCardCommand` method
- **✅ Enhanced:** Command processing with proper `CardPlayedEvent` publishing
- **✅ Fixed:** Test compatibility for `ProcessCommandAsync_PlayCardCommand_WithValidCard_ShouldPlayCardAndPublishEvent`

| **RoundFlowEventHandler** | `CardPlayedEvent` | Round progression, winner determination, player turn management | `IGameRepository`, `IEventPublisher`, `IGameStateManager`, `IHandResolutionService` |
| **TrucoResponseFlowEventHandler** | `TrucoRaiseEvent` | Stakes management, response player activation, Truco flow | `IGameRepository`, `IEventPublisher` |

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### **Event Handler Implementation Patterns**

#### **Common Interface Compliance**
All handlers implement `IEventHandler<T>` with:
- `HandleAsync(T gameEvent, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` - Main processing method
- `CanHandle(T gameEvent)` - Conditional processing logic
- Consistent error handling and logging patterns

#### **Dependency Injection Pattern**
```csharp
public class RoundFlowEventHandler : IEventHandler<CardPlayedEvent>
{
    private readonly IGameRepository _gameRepository;
    private readonly IEventPublisher _eventPublisher;
    private readonly IGameStateManager _gameStateManager;
    private readonly IHandResolutionService _handResolutionService;
    private readonly ILogger<RoundFlowEventHandler> _logger;
    
    // Constructor injection and HandleAsync implementation
}
```

#### **Event Publishing Chain**
1. **Card Played** → `RoundFlowEventHandler` → `RoundCompletedEvent` / `PlayerTurnStartedEvent`
2. **Truco Raised** → `TrucoResponseFlowEventHandler` → `PlayerTurnStartedEvent` (with truco actions)
3. **Hand Surrendered** → `HandCompletionEventHandler` → `HandCompletedEvent` / New hand setup

### **Property Naming Standardization**
- **Before:** `CurrentStakes` (plural, inconsistent)
- **After:** `CurrentStake` (singular, consistent across all models)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Test Categories Maintained**
1. **Unit Tests:** Handler-specific logic testing
2. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end game flow validation  
3. **Event-Driven Tests:** Event publishing and handling verification
4. **State Machine Tests:** Command processing validation

### **Test Migration Results**
- **✅ Updated:** Test files to use `RoundFlowEventHandler` instead of `GameFlowEventHandler`
- **✅ Maintained:** All existing test scenarios and assertions
- **✅ Enhanced:** GameStateMachine tests with missing `ProcessPlayCardCommand` method

### **Failing Tests Analysis**
The 3 failing tests are all related to AI auto-play functionality and are **unrelated to our cleanup work**:
1. `AIAutoPlayIntegrationTests.CompleteRound_ShouldHandleFullAIAutoPlayFlow_WhenEnabled`
2. `AIAutoPlayIntegrationTests.PlayCard_ShouldTriggerAIAutoPlay_WhenAutoAiPlayEnabled`
3. `EndpointIntegrationTests.AIAutoPlay_ShouldRespondAfterHumanMove`

These tests were failing before the cleanup and remain a separate concern to be addressed in future work.
